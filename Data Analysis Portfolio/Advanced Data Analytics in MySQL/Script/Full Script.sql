-- CUSTOMER REPORT VIEW
-- ========================================
-- Purpose:
-- This report presents key customer metrics, focusing on 
-- transaction details, order behavior, and key performance indicators (KPIs).
-- 
-- HIGHLIGHTS:
-- 1. Extract essential customer fields (ID, name, transaction details)
-- 2. Aggregate customer-level metrics:
--    - Total orders
--    - Total sales 
--    - Total quantity purchased 
--    - Total unique products bought
-- 3. Compute key KPIs:
--    - Average Order Value (AOV)
