Advanced Data Analytics in MySQL

📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates advanced data analytics in MySQL. The dataset focuses on store sales forecasting, covering various analytical aspects such as change-over-time analysis, cumulative analysis, performance analysis, part-to-whole analysis, and data segmentation.

The main objective is to extract meaningful insights regarding sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance using SQL queries, window functions, common table expressions (CTEs), and data aggregation techniques.

🔍 Primary Analysis & Queries

1️⃣ Change-Over-Time Analysis

Monthly Sales Analysis: Analyzes total sales, unique customers, and quantity sold on a month-by-month and year-by-year basis.

2️⃣ Cumulative Analysis

Running Total Sales: Uses window functions to compute cumulative sales over time.

Moving Average Profit: Tracks profitability trends over time.

3️⃣ Performance Analysis

Yearly Product Sales Performance: Compares current-year sales with average sales and previous-year sales using window functions.

Identifies products with above or below average performance and tracks year-over-year sales fluctuations.

4️⃣ Part-To-Whole Analysis

Sub-category Contribution: Measures each sub-category's contribution to overall sales.

State Contribution: Evaluates the revenue contribution of different states.

5️⃣ Data Segmentation

Product Segmentation by Profit Ranges: Categorizes products into profit segments (low, medium, high-profit margins).

6️⃣ Customer Report View

Combines key customer metrics: total sales, total orders, average order value (AOV), and product variety.

Creates a database view for easy customer analysis.

🛠️ Technologies & Techniques Used

SQL Window Functions (SUM, AVG, LAG, etc.)

Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

Data Aggregation & Summarization

CASE Statements for Data Segmentation

Views for Efficient Reporting
